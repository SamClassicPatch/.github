# Welcome!

This is a fan-made patch for [**The First Encounter**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/41050/Serious_Sam_Classic_The_First_Encounter/) and [**The Second Encounter**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/41060/Serious_Sam_Classic_The_Second_Encounter/) that includes lots of enhancements and new functionality for the game client, dedicated servers, tool applications and even gameplay logic. Despite this, it's perfectly compatible with vanilla servers and user-made content.

The goal of this project is to enhance user experience, as well as provide new ways of modding the games and, of course, play them.
